[Sep 19 2009]

 * ADDED: Turtle write library.

[Sep 9 2009]

 * MODIFIED: rdf_load/2 no longer shares blank nodes by default.  This is
   not allowed according to the standards.

[Sep 1 2009]

 * ADDED: First version of low-level primitives for faster Turtle support

 * CLEANUP: make RDF library depend on new iri_xml_namespace/3.

[Aug 31 2009]

 * ADDED: rdf_graph_prefixes/3 and realised various enhancements

[Aug 26 2009]

 * FIXED: rdf_graph_prefixes/2 to return all namespaces instead of only those
   that have ns/2 declarations (as the title suggests).

[Aug 24 2009]

 * MODIFIED: RDF hook no longer accepts text/html explicitely

[Aug 21 2009]

 * FIXED: Turtle parser to deal with files where the last line is a
   non-terminated comment.  Ivo Swartjes

[Aug 20 2009]

 * ADDED: Library semweb/rdf_compare for comparing RDF graphs (mostly used by
   RDF test libraries)

 * ADDED: Process the text/turtle MIME-type

 * ADDED: Turtle parser to support booleans (true and false)

[Aug 19 2009]

 * MODIFIED: rdf_process_turtle/3 prints messages instead of aborting after
   the first error.  Also some progress to enhance the error messages.

 * ADDED: rdf_current_ns/2 as a replacement for rdf_db:ns/2 and rdf_graph_prefixes/2
   to query prefixes used in a specific graph.

[Jul 31 2009]

 * FIXED: rdf_load/1 failed after unloading the data using rdf_unload/1. Willem Robert van Hage.

[Jul 30 2009]

 * CLEANUP: Modernise rdf.pl and rdf_db.pl module handling.

[Jul 24 2009]

 * MODIFIED: rdf_load_turtle/3 now returns IRIs instead of URIs.
[Jul 21 2009]

 * MODIFIED: Make initialization/1 ISO compliant
   This patch is a modest cleanup to the implementation of '$load_file'/3
   from init.pl and provides an ISO compatible implementation of
   initialization/1. This executes the argument goal *after* loading the
   file rather than when encountering the directive. Often this makes no
   difference, but notably load_foreign_library/1 is an exception.
   Therefore we added use_foreign_library/1,2 that act as a directive and
   provides proper integration with saved-states automatically.  Loading
   code using initialization(load_foreign_library(...)) will load the
   library immediately and issue a warning.

   See initialization/1,2 for details and further hints for dealing with
   possible compatibility problems.

[Jul 19 2009]

[May 31 2009]

 * FIXED: RDF Transaction logging in persistency layer.  Jacco van Ossenbruggen.

[Mar 19 2009]

 * CLEANUP: Removed all trailing whitespace from all source-files.  This avoids many GIT (merge) warnings.
[Mar 12 2009]

 * MODIFIED: Renamed concat_atom/2,3 into atomic_list_concat/2,3 for compatibility.  Moved the old predicates into library(backcomp).  It is adviced to update your code, but 99% of the code will remain working because the old definitions are autoloaded.

[Mar 5 2009]

 * FIXED: ensure the local part after splitting a URI is a valid XML name

 * MODIFIED: Use graph(URI) instead of db(URI) for specifying the RDF graph that must be saved.  db(URI) is still supported for backward compatibility.
[Jan 21 2009]

   that must be %-escaped.  Jacopo Urbani.

[Jan 13 2009]

[Apr 27 2008]

 * FIXED: RDF-DB: predicate hash error that caused most predicates to be
   hashed on the same key. Fixes slow rdf_save/2 reported by Jacco van
   Ossenbruggen. Should also positively effect determinism and reliability
   of rdf_estimate_complexity/4.

[Apr 26 2008]

 * DOC: Fixed some paths in semweb documentation.  Jacco van Ossenbruggen

[Apr 18 2008]
